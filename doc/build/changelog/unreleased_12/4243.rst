    Added new attribute :attr:`.Query.lazy_loaded_from` which is populated
    with an :class:`.InstanceState` that is using this :class:`.Query` in
    order to lazy load a relationship.  The rationale for this is that
    it serves as a hint for the horizontal sharding feature to use, such that
    the identity token of the state can be used as the default identity token
    to use for the query within id_chooser().

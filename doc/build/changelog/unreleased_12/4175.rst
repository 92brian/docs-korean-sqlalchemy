    Fixed bug where the :class:`.Bundle` object did not
    correctly report upon the primary :class:`.Mapper` object
    represened by the bundle, if any.   An immediate
    side effect of this issue was that the new selectinload
    loader strategy wouldn't work with the horizontal sharding
    extension.

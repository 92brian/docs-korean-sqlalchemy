    Fixed regression caused by :ticket:`4256` (itself a regression fix for
    :ticket:`4228`) which breaks an undocumented behavior which converted for a
    non-sequence of entities passed directly to the :class:`.Query` constructor
    into a single-element sequence.  While this behavior was never supported or
    documented, it's already in use so has been added as a behavioral contract
    to :class:`.Query`.

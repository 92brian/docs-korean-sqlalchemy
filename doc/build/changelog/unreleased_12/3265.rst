    A test added in 1.2 thought to confirm a Python 2.7 behavior turns out to
    be confirming the behavior only as of Python 2.7.8. Python bug #8743 still
    impacts set comparison in Python 2.7.7 and earlier, so the test in question
    involving AssociationSet no longer runs for these older Python 2.7
    versions.

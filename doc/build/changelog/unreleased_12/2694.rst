   Reworked the new "autoescape" feature introduced in
   :ref:`change_2694` in 1.2.0b2 to be fully automatic; the escape
   character now defaults to a forwards slash ``"/"`` and
   is applied to percent, underscore, as well as the escape
   character itself, for fully automatic escaping.  The
   character can also be changed using the "escape" parameter.
